**1.isdigit**<br/>
A function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).<br/>
Prototype: int _isdigit(int c);<br/>
Returns 1 if c is a digit<br/>
Returns 0 otherwise<br/>
**2.Collaboration is multiplication**<br/>
A function that multiplies two integers.<br/>
Prototype: int mul(int a, int b);<br/>
**3.The numbers speak for themselves**<br/>
A function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.<br/>
Prototype: void print_numbers(void);<br/>
use _putchar twice in your code<br/>
**4.I believe in numbers and signs** <br/>
Function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.<br/>
Prototype: void print_most_numbers(void);<br/>
Do not print 2 and 4<br/>
use _putchar twice in your code<br/>
**5.Numbers constitute the only universal language** <br/>
Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.<br/>
Prototype: void more_numbers(void);<br/>
use _putchar three times in your code<br/>
**6.The shortest distance between two points is a straight line** <br/>
Function that draws a straight line in the terminal.<br/>
Prototype: void print_line(int n);<br/>
use _putchar function to print<br/>
Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed<br/>
The line should end with a \n<br/>
If n is 0 or less, the function should only print \n<br/>
**7.I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe** <br/>
Function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.<br/>
Prototype: void print_diagonal(int n);<br/>
use _putchar function to print<br/>
Where n is the number of times the character \ should be printed<br/>
The diagonal should end with a \n<br/>
If n is 0 or less, the function should only print a \n<br/>
**8.You are so much sunshine in every square inch**<br/>
Function that prints a square, followed by a new line.<br/>
Prototype: void print_square(int size);<br/>
use _putchar function to print<br/>
Where size is the size of the square<br/>
If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line<br/>
Use the character # to print the square<br/>
**9. Fizz-Buzz**<br/>
Program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. <br/>
But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. <br/>
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.<br/>
Each number or word should be separated by a space<br/>
**10. Triangles**<br/>
A function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.<br/>
** 11. The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic** <br/>
A program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.<br/>
